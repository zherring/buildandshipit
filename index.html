            <li><a href="/meme-generator">Meme Generator</a> <br />What started as an excuse to fiddle with Vue and write API calls in CodePen turned into a fun little hackathon project.</li>
            <li><a href="/ultimately-me">Ultimately Me</a><br /> Written with two of my best friends, this was a fun project that turned painful on release. Written in Angular 1.3.x, wrapping in PhoneGap and then released in iOS and Play stores, you wouldn't be surprised to hear multiple layers of abstraction lead to performance hits, GUI glitches and just general headaches all around. All native, next time.</li>
